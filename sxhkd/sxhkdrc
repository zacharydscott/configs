### SXHKD configuration

################################################################
# I'm trying a little theming with the commands here.
# note quite a full vim level of descriptive commands,
# but it still should have some consistency and
# expressiveness.
# 
# help
# super - used for for all bspc based hotkeys. This 
# 	is to prevent overlap with window programs.
#
# ctrl - "desktop mode" to mirror the hotkeys
# 	for nodes with the alt key. I'm cheating
# 	for the super + # commands, as it increases
# 	ease of use significantly.
#
# alt - primarily used for special commands, such
# 	as restart bspwm or power down
#
# qwer - reserved for system commands
